miniScan is an ultra simple port scanner program which accepts command line arguments. 
By default, miniScan only requires and argument for a host. A host can be passed to the proxram as an IP address 
(x.x.x.x) or a url (www.xxx.com), and will scan well known ports using TCP. Command line arguments can specify 
multiple hosts, ports, and select UDP as the scan type. UDP port scanning is still a work in progress at the moment.
